# ViT-Fuse
A self-developed real multi-spectral image dataset. These codes propose a Transformer-based feature interaction network and an adaptive weight fusion network, named Multi-modal Feature-Decision Fusion Network, to address the interaction of information from multiple modalities and achieve superior target detection.
